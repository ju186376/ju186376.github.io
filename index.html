        About Me
      </h2>

      <p style="color:white; text-align:center">
        I am currently a junior here at UCF and working towards my degree in
        Digital Media Web Design. When I first started here at UCF in 2021, 
        I was a Computer Science major and thought that it was what I always 
        wanted to do. It was until I came up here and took a few classes that 
        I came to realize that I had no interest in the subject matter and 
        because of that began to do bad in those classes. It was when I was 
        at my lowest that I was able to see that this wasn't for me and looked
        at other things that caught my interest. It was then that I stumbled on
        Digital Media Web Design and realized that I wanted to lean more towards
        that side of coding, a more specified side that also takes into account
        the creative side I cultivated in high school that seeminlgy was just 
        for fun until recently. I am now much happier and like learning new 
        things in order to make websites both functional and looking visually
        appealing.

            The assignment above had us remodel an app we use on a frequent basis
            and give it a different design to make it more aesthetically pleasing.
            The hardest part was figuring out a way to keep the core concepts of
            the app while making it easier on the eyes and much more appealing, but 
            by simply playing around with colors and ideas I figured out something
            I liked.

            The flash card app above was a challenge to make one that has certain
            paramaters that had to be included in the design of the app. The hardest
            part in my opinion was figuring out a base design that I liked as I felt
            like making everything else would be easier once a solid idea was in place.

            The gif above shows a GitHub page that we made in order to show off an app 
            we coded. The hardest part of this assignment was getting it to work and 
            pulling it all together, as I was struggling to get the pages up and getting
            the code to work, but in the end I figured it out and was able to submit the 
            assignment.
